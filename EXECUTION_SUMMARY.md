## 🎯 Portfolio Positioning

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I built a real-time IoT analytics platform for smart building energy management in just 5 days. It processes 10,000+ sensor readings per second using ClickHouse, detects anomalies with 90% accuracy using machine learning, and forecasts energy consumption 7 days ahead with less than 10% error. The platform tracks carbon footprint in real-time and provides actionable optimization recommendations. I integrated AutoCAD floor plans and 3D visualizations, demonstrating both data science and CAD skills. The entire project—from database design to ML models to interactive dashboards—showcases my ability to deliver production-ready solutions quickly."

### Key Talking Points

1. **Speed**: "Production-ready in 5 days"
2. **Scale**: "1 million+ data points, sub-second queries"
3. **Impact**: "20% energy savings, carbon reduction"
4. **Tools**: "ClickHouse, ML, Autodesk—industry-leading stack"
5. **Scope**: "7 technical domains in one project"

### Interview Questions You Can Answer

✅ "Describe a data pipeline you've built"
✅ "How do you optimize database performance?"
✅ "Explain an ML model you've deployed"
✅ "How do you handle time-series data?"
✅ "Tell me about a project with tight deadlines"
✅ "How do you approach new technologies?"

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Scope Creep
❌ Don't add features beyond MVP
✅ Focus on core functionality first

### Perfectionism
❌ Don't spend 3 hours perfecting one dashboard
✅ Good enough is good enough for v1

### Autodesk Time Sink
❌ Don't try to master Revit in 2 days
✅ Use templates, focus on concepts

### Documentation Delay
❌ Don't leave all docs for Day 5
✅ Document as you build

### Testing Neglect
❌ Don't skip testing until the end
✅ Test after each component

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Time Management
- Set timer for each task (use Pomodoro)
- Don't exceed planned time per section
- If stuck, move on and return later

### Code Quality
- Use provided templates as starting points
- Copy-paste-modify > write from scratch
- Focus on working code over perfect code

### Documentation
- Take screenshots immediately after building
- Write notes in real-time
- Use voice memos if typing is slow

### Autodesk
- Watch 30-min tutorials only
- Use pre-made blocks/models
- Export early and often

### Demos
- Record video even if imperfect
- Show the journey, not just results
- Explain challenges faced
