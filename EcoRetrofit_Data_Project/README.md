# EcoRetrofit Data Project: Smart Home & BIM Analytics with ClickHouse

## 🌍 Overview
This project leverages **ClickHouse**, **AI**, and **Data Science** to optimize Smart Home energy efficiency and recommend Retrofit solutions. It is designed to integrate with **Autodesk** workflows (BIM/Revit) by providing the analytical backbone for sustainable engineering decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Analyze** IoT sensor data from Smart Homes (Energy, Temperature, Humidity).
- **Detect** inefficiencies using AI/Statistical methods.
- **Recommend** specific Retrofit interventions (e.g., Insulation, Lighting, Glazing) based on data.
- **Demonstrate** the power of ClickHouse for high-speed time-series processing.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Database:** ClickHouse (Cloud)
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Analysis:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- **Visualization:** Streamlit, Plotly
- **Workflow:** VS Code, PyCharm, Colab, Vibe Coding (AI Native)
