# How I Built a Smart Home Analytics Engine with ClickHouse & AI in 5 Days

*Subtitle: From Zero to Data Engineering Hero – A journey into Sustainable Tech.*

## The Challenge
I had 5 days and $300 in ClickHouse credits to build something impactful. My goal? To bridge the gap between **Data Science** and **Civil Engineering** (BIM/Retrofit).

## The Solution: EcoRetrofit
I built a system that:
1.  **Ingests** high-frequency IoT sensor data from simulated homes into ClickHouse.
2.  **Analyzes** energy patterns using Python & Isolation Forests (AI) to detect waste.
3.  **Recommends** specific construction materials (Insulation, Glazing) to solve the root cause.

## Tech Stack
- **ClickHouse Cloud:** For blazing fast time-series queries.
- **Python & Streamlit:** For the AI logic and interactive dashboard.
- **Generative AI:** Used to accelerate code development and schema design.

## Key Takeaways
- **Speed:** ClickHouse handled millions of sensor rows effortlessly.
- **Impact:** By combining AI with Engineering data, we move from "monitoring" to "solving".
- **Future:** The next step is connecting this directly to Autodesk Revit for a full Digital Twin workflow.
